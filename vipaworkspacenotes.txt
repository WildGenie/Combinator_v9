- remove yavg, tavg from spectraobject as they are no longer necessary

- FFT x axis seems to be off by a factor of 2

- Add "new figure" capabilities

- Add x and y labels to fits plots

- Add "make spectra without reference"

- Remove bg substraction when averaging spectra

- Add real-time fitting of spectra

Cosmetic / Ease of use

- "Save" option for all open figures, email as well.

- Add normalization option in group plots

- "New" button and menu item should set image destination

- Add x and y labels to fits plots

1. Use OPO only to collect fringes, with vapor cell.

2. Record a reference image with the vapor cell.

3. Feed in methane and record a signal image with the vapor cell.
