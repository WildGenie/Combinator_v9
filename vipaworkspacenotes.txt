- Add "new figure" capabilities

- Add x and y labels to fits plots

- Add "make spectra without reference"

- Remove bg substraction when averaging spectra

- "New" button and menu item should set image destination

1. Use OPO only to collect fringes, with vapor cell.

2. Record a reference image with the vapor cell.

3. Feed in methane and record a signal image with the vapor cell.
