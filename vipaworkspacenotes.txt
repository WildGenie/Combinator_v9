- Add simbiology simulation option to "fit analysis" panel

- Add table option in fits to input initial conditions.

- Allow for setting of the approximate calibration function

- remove yavg, tavg from spectraobject as they are no longer necessary

- Add code for "instrument linewidth" panel items
